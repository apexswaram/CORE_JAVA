# Features of Java

Java is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, platform independence, and robustness which makes it versatile for a wide range of applications. Some most important core features in java are as below :-

---

## 1. Platform-Independent

**Definition :**  
Java applications are designed to run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without requiring modification.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode :**  
Java source code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode (.class files). Bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM. This bytecode is portable across different operating systems and hardware configurations.

**JVM :**  
The JVM is a crucial component of Java’s platform independence. It interprets or compiles bytecode into native machine code specific to the underlying hardware and operating system. By adhering to the JVM specification, Java applications can run consistently on any platform that has a JVM implementation.

---

## 2. Object-Oriented

**Definition :**  
Java is built around the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Encapsulation :**  
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Access to the data is controlled using access modifiers like private, protected, and public, which helps in protecting the integrity of the data and exposing only what is necessary.

**Inheritance :**  
Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit the fields and methods of another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy. For example, a Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, gaining all its attributes and behaviors.

**Polymorphism :**  
Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It allows methods to be overridden in derived classes and provides flexibility in method invocation. For example, a method makeSound() can be defined in a parent class Animal and overridden in subclasses Dog and Cat to produce different sounds.

**Abstraction :**  
Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define what methods a class should implement without specifying how these methods should be implemented.

---

## 3. Robust

**Definition :**  
Java is designed to be a reliable and error-resistant programming language.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Exception Handling :**  
Java uses a structured approach to handle runtime errors through exceptions. The language provides robust exception handling mechanisms using try, catch, finally, and throw keywords, enabling developers to handle and recover from errors gracefully.

**Automatic Garbage Collection :**  
Java’s garbage collector automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable, reducing the risk of memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory management.

**Type Checking :**  
Java performs strict type checking at compile-time and runtime. This ensures that operations are performed on compatible data types and helps catch errors early in the development process.

---

## 4. Secure

**Definition :**  
Java incorporates various security features to protect applications from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode Verification :**  
Before execution, Java bytecode undergoes verification to ensure it adheres to the Java language specification and does not contain illegal code that could compromise the security of the JVM.

**Sandboxing :**  
Java applets and applications can run in a restricted environment called a sandbox, which limits their ability to access system resources and perform potentially harmful operations. This is especially important for applets running in a web browser.

**Security Manager :**  
Java includes a security manager that allows applications to set security policies and control access to sensitive system resources like files, network connections, and system properties.

---

## 5. Portable

**Definition :**  
Java's portability allows compiled programs to run on any platform with a JVM, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode and JVM :**  
Java compiles code into platform-independent bytecode, executable on any JVM.

**No Recompilation :**  
Unlike C/C++, Java doesn't require platform-specific recompilation.

**Standard Libraries :**  
Libraries handle system-specific differences, maintaining consistent behavior.

**Example :**  
A Java app compiled on Windows runs seamlessly on Linux or macOS if JVM is installed.

---

## 6. Simple

**Definition :**  
Java is designed to be a straightforward and accessible programming language.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Syntax and Structure :**  
Java’s syntax is derived from C and C++ but is simplified to remove complex features that often lead to errors. For instance, it eliminates explicit pointers, which can lead to memory leaks and undefined behavior.

**Automatic Memory Management :**  
Java handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically, reducing the burden on developers to manage memory manually. This reduces the risk of memory leaks and errors related to memory management.

**No Multiple Inheritance :**  
Java does not support multiple inheritance. Instead, Java uses interfaces to achieve multiple inheritance of type.

---

## 7. Multithreaded

**Definition :**  
Java provides built-in support for concurrent execution, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Threading Support :**  
Java provides a comprehensive threading model with the java.lang.Thread class and the java.util.concurrent package.

**Synchronization :**  
Java includes mechanisms to manage access to shared resources among threads using synchronized and locking utilities.

# What is JVM ?

The JVM is a part of the Java platform that executes Java bytecode, converting it into machine code for the host system. It provides an abstraction layer between compiled Java code and the operating system.  
The main use of the JVM is to enable platform-independent execution of Java programs by interpreting or compiling bytecode to machine code, managing memory, ensuring security, and optimizing performance.

Below is the diagram showing JVM architecture in JRE.  
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by Deepak Smart Programming

---

## Components of JVM :-

There are 3 main components in JVM :-

- **Class Loader:**  
The class loader is responsible for dynamically loading Java classes into memory at runtime. It handles loading, linking, and initialization, organizing classes into namespaces and ensuring they are available for execution.

- **Memory Areas:**  
The JVM's memory areas include the heap (for objects), stack (for method calls and local variables), method area (for class-level data), and native method stacks. These regions manage memory allocation, storage of program data, and execution context.

- **Execution Engine:**  
The execution engine interprets or compiles bytecode into machine code for execution by the CPU. It includes the interpreter for line-by-line execution and the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for optimizing frequently executed code paths.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) = Class Loader + Memory Areas + Execution Engine

---

## Usage of JVM :-

The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into native machine code that can be executed by the host machine. This enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM implementation, adhering to the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere.

---

# Structure of Java Program

When writing a program in any programming language, it's important to follow a basic structure recommended by experts. Typically, a Java program is made up of the following parts, as shown in the figure below.

Structure of Java Program

This structure if explained below :-

---

## 1. Package Declaration Statement (Optional)

The package declaration specifies the package name for the Java class. It is the first statement in a Java program (if present).

**Purpose :**  
Package statement is used to group related classes and organize the code.

**Syntax :**
```java
package packageName;
````

**Example :**

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

---

## 2. Import Statements (If Necessary)

The import statement is used to include other Java classes or packages in the program, enabling the use of pre-defined classes (e.g., java.util.Scanner).

**Purpose :**
Import statement is used to import built-in or user-defined classes for reusability.

**Syntax :**

```java
import packageName.ClassName;  // Imports a specific class
import packageName.*;          // Imports all classes in the package
```

**Example :**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Imports Scanner class
import java.util.*;        // Imports all classes in java.util package
```

## 3. Class Definition Statements

The class is the fundamental building block of a Java program. Every Java program must have at least one class.

**Syntax :**

```java
class ClassName {
    // Class body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public class Car {
    // Class members go here
}
```

We can create any number of classes in one program.
There should be atleast one main class which should contains the main() method as main() method is the entry point for the program.

A class can include the following components which are known as **"Class Members"**:

* Variables : Also called fields or attributes, which hold data.
* Constructors : Used to initialize objects.
* Methods : Define behaviors or actions of the class.
* etc...

---

### 3.1 Variables Declaration Statements (Optional) [Class Members]

Variables are used to store data and are declared within the class (as fields) or within methods (local variables).

**Syntax :**

```java
dataType variableName = value; // Field or local variable declaration
```

**Example :**

```java
String model = "Tata Nexon";    // Field
int year = 2020;               // Field
```

---

### 3.2 Constructors Declaration Statements (Optional) [Class Members]

Constructor is a special method having same name as that of class name but should name have any return type.

A constructor initializes objects of a class. If no constructor is provided, Java supplies a default constructor.

**Syntax :**

```java
ClassName() {
    // Constructor body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public Car() {
    System.out.println("Constructor called!");
}
```

---

### 3.3 Methods Declaration Statements [Class Members]

Methods are the set of codes which performs a particular task.
We can create any number of methods in one class.

**Syntax :**

```java
accessModifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Method body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public void start() {
    System.out.println("Car Started");
}
```

---

### 3.4 Main Method [Class Members]

main() method is the entry point for java program from where program execution starts.
main() method can have different syntax but below is the standard syntax that we should use.

**Syntax :**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Maheswaram...!!");
}
```

# Simple Java Hello Program


## MainApp.java

```java
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Deepak");
    }
}
````

In this example, we have a class named MainApp, and within this class, there is a main method. The method prints "Hello Deepak...!!" to the console.

---

## Breaking Down the program as below:-

## Java Hello Program Deep Explanation

---

### 1. public (Keyword - Access Modifier)

The "public access modifier keyword" declares that the MainApp class is accessible from anywhere in the program (other packages are also included) and JVM can invoke it from outside the class.

Note that when a class is declared as public, it must have the same name as the file name (in this case, MainApp.java).

---

### 2. class (Keyword)

The "class keyword" is used to define a class in Java, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

The class can contain :-

* Variables: Store data or attributes of the class.
* Constructors: Initialize the object’s state.
* Methods: Define the behavior or actions of the class.

---

### 3. MainApp (User-Defined Class Name)

The "MainApp" is the user-defined class name which contains the overall program.

The class must follows the Java naming conventions (CamelCase starting with an uppercase letter).

The "MainApp" class acts as the entry point of the program because it contains the main method.

---

### 4. { (Class Opening Curly Brace)

Here "{" denotes the beginning of the class definition.

Every class body is enclosed in curly braces.

---

### 5. public (Keyword - Access Modifier)

The "public access modifier keyword" here makes the main method accessible to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) so it can execute the program.

---

### 6. static (Keyword)

The "static keyword" denotes that the main method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.

It means that the main method is called without creating an object of the MainApp class.

---

### 7. void (Keyword - Return Type)

The "void return-type keyword" indicates that the main method does not return any value.

Since the program’s execution does not require any return value from the main method, it is declared void.

---

### 8. main (Pre-Defined Method)

The "main pre-defined method" is an entry point of the program from where execution begins.

The JVM looks for this specific method (main() method) to start the program. If there is no main() method then JVM will not start the program execution.

---

### 9. String[] (Parameter Type - Array of Strings)

The "String[] parameter type" is used for Command-line Arguments. It holds the arguments passed to the program when it is executed via the command line.

For example: If we run
`java MainApp Hello Deepak`, the array will contain:

* String[0] = "Hello"
* String[1] = "Deepak"

---

### 10. args (Parameter Name - Argunment Variable)

The "args" is the user-defined variable name for the String[] parameter.

"args" is the short name for arguments, but can be renamed to any valid identifier (e.g., data or parameters).

It is used to hold the command-line arguments passed to the program.

---

### 11. { (Method Opening Curly Brace)

Here "{" denotes the beginning of the main method body.

---

### 12. System (Pre-Defined Class Name)

"System" is the built-in Java class from java.lang package.

It provides access to system-level functionality, such as input/output streams, properties, and environment variables.

It contains:

* in: Standard input stream (e.g., keyboard input).
* out: Standard output stream (e.g., console output).
* err: Standard error stream (e.g., error messages).

---

### 13. . (Member Access Operator)

"." is the member access operator which is used to access fields, methods and nested classes of a class or an object.

For example: `System.out` accesses the out field of the System class.

It contains:

* in: Standard input stream (e.g., keyboard input).
* out: Standard output stream (e.g., console output).
* err: Standard error stream (e.g., error messages).

---

### 14. out (Pre-Defined Object)

"out" is the static member (field or property) of "System" class that represents the standard output stream (usually the console).

It is used to print the data like strings, numbers or objects to the console.

---

### 15. println (Pre-Defined Method)

"println" is the pre-defined method of "PrintStream" class (referenced by System.out).

It prints the given text or data to the console and moves the cursor to a new line.

---

### 16. "Hello Deepak" (String Literal)

"Hello Deepak" is the sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

The text Hello Deepak is passed as an argument to the println method and will be displayed in the console.

---

### 16. ; [Semicolon] (Statement Terminator)

";" marks the end of a statement in Java. Every executable statement must be terminated with a semicolon.

---

### 17. } (Method Closing Curly Brace:)

Here "}" marks the end of the main method body.

---

### 18. } (Class Closing Curly Brace)

Here "}" marks the end of the class definition.

 How to compile and run Java Program using CMD ?
 To compile and run a Java program using Notepad, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Java (if not already done)
Install JDK (if not installed click here for steps)
Verify the installation:
Open a Command Prompt.
Type java -version and javac -version. If both commands display version information, Java is set up correctly.
Step 2: Write the Java Program
Open Notepad.
Write Java program code as below :
MainApp.java
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Deepak");
    }
}
Save the file with a .java extension. For example:
File Name: MainApp.java
Location: Save it in a directory, e.g., d:\JavaPrograms
Step 3: Compile the Java Program
Open a Command Prompt.
Navigate to the directory where we have saved the .java file. For example:
cd /d D:\JavaPrograms
 cd means Change Directory.
 The /d switch changes the drive while navigating to the directory.
Compile the program using javac:
javac MainApp.java
If there is no error in the code then it will generate .class file in the same location where .java file is present. But if there is an error in code then it will display the error.
Step 4: Run the Java Program
Run the compiled program using the java command:
java MainApp
Output: Hello Deepak
