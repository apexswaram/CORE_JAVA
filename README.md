# Features of Java

Java is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, platform independence, and robustness which makes it versatile for a wide range of applications. Some most important core features in java are as below :-

---

## 1. Platform-Independent

**Definition :**  
Java applications are designed to run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without requiring modification.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode :**  
Java source code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode (.class files). Bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM. This bytecode is portable across different operating systems and hardware configurations.

**JVM :**  
The JVM is a crucial component of Java’s platform independence. It interprets or compiles bytecode into native machine code specific to the underlying hardware and operating system. By adhering to the JVM specification, Java applications can run consistently on any platform that has a JVM implementation.

---

## 2. Object-Oriented

**Definition :**  
Java is built around the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), which organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Encapsulation :**  
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Access to the data is controlled using access modifiers like private, protected, and public, which helps in protecting the integrity of the data and exposing only what is necessary.

**Inheritance :**  
Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit the fields and methods of another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy. For example, a Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, gaining all its attributes and behaviors.

**Polymorphism :**  
Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It allows methods to be overridden in derived classes and provides flexibility in method invocation. For example, a method makeSound() can be defined in a parent class Animal and overridden in subclasses Dog and Cat to produce different sounds.

**Abstraction :**  
Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define what methods a class should implement without specifying how these methods should be implemented.

---

## 3. Robust

**Definition :**  
Java is designed to be a reliable and error-resistant programming language.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Exception Handling :**  
Java uses a structured approach to handle runtime errors through exceptions. The language provides robust exception handling mechanisms using try, catch, finally, and throw keywords, enabling developers to handle and recover from errors gracefully.

**Automatic Garbage Collection :**  
Java’s garbage collector automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable, reducing the risk of memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory management.

**Type Checking :**  
Java performs strict type checking at compile-time and runtime. This ensures that operations are performed on compatible data types and helps catch errors early in the development process.

---

## 4. Secure

**Definition :**  
Java incorporates various security features to protect applications from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode Verification :**  
Before execution, Java bytecode undergoes verification to ensure it adheres to the Java language specification and does not contain illegal code that could compromise the security of the JVM.

**Sandboxing :**  
Java applets and applications can run in a restricted environment called a sandbox, which limits their ability to access system resources and perform potentially harmful operations. This is especially important for applets running in a web browser.

**Security Manager :**  
Java includes a security manager that allows applications to set security policies and control access to sensitive system resources like files, network connections, and system properties.

---

## 5. Portable

**Definition :**  
Java's portability allows compiled programs to run on any platform with a JVM, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Bytecode and JVM :**  
Java compiles code into platform-independent bytecode, executable on any JVM.

**No Recompilation :**  
Unlike C/C++, Java doesn't require platform-specific recompilation.

**Standard Libraries :**  
Libraries handle system-specific differences, maintaining consistent behavior.

**Example :**  
A Java app compiled on Windows runs seamlessly on Linux or macOS if JVM is installed.

---

## 6. Simple

**Definition :**  
Java is designed to be a straightforward and accessible programming language.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Syntax and Structure :**  
Java’s syntax is derived from C and C++ but is simplified to remove complex features that often lead to errors. For instance, it eliminates explicit pointers, which can lead to memory leaks and undefined behavior.

**Automatic Memory Management :**  
Java handles memory allocation and garbage collection automatically, reducing the burden on developers to manage memory manually. This reduces the risk of memory leaks and errors related to memory management.

**No Multiple Inheritance :**  
Java does not support multiple inheritance. Instead, Java uses interfaces to achieve multiple inheritance of type.

---

## 7. Multithreaded

**Definition :**  
Java provides built-in support for concurrent execution, allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously.

**Detailed Explanation :**

**Threading Support :**  
Java provides a comprehensive threading model with the java.lang.Thread class and the java.util.concurrent package.

**Synchronization :**  
Java includes mechanisms to manage access to shared resources among threads using synchronized and locking utilities.

# What is JVM ?

The JVM is a part of the Java platform that executes Java bytecode, converting it into machine code for the host system. It provides an abstraction layer between compiled Java code and the operating system.  
The main use of the JVM is to enable platform-independent execution of Java programs by interpreting or compiling bytecode to machine code, managing memory, ensuring security, and optimizing performance.

Below is the diagram showing JVM architecture in JRE.  
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by Deepak Smart Programming

---

## Components of JVM :-

There are 3 main components in JVM :-

- **Class Loader:**  
The class loader is responsible for dynamically loading Java classes into memory at runtime. It handles loading, linking, and initialization, organizing classes into namespaces and ensuring they are available for execution.

- **Memory Areas:**  
The JVM's memory areas include the heap (for objects), stack (for method calls and local variables), method area (for class-level data), and native method stacks. These regions manage memory allocation, storage of program data, and execution context.

- **Execution Engine:**  
The execution engine interprets or compiles bytecode into machine code for execution by the CPU. It includes the interpreter for line-by-line execution and the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for optimizing frequently executed code paths.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) = Class Loader + Memory Areas + Execution Engine

---

## Usage of JVM :-

The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into native machine code that can be executed by the host machine. This enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM implementation, adhering to the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere.

---

# Structure of Java Program

When writing a program in any programming language, it's important to follow a basic structure recommended by experts. Typically, a Java program is made up of the following parts, as shown in the figure below.

Structure of Java Program

This structure if explained below :-

---

## 1. Package Declaration Statement (Optional)

The package declaration specifies the package name for the Java class. It is the first statement in a Java program (if present).

**Purpose :**  
Package statement is used to group related classes and organize the code.

**Syntax :**
```java
package packageName;
````

**Example :**

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

---

## 2. Import Statements (If Necessary)

The import statement is used to include other Java classes or packages in the program, enabling the use of pre-defined classes (e.g., java.util.Scanner).

**Purpose :**
Import statement is used to import built-in or user-defined classes for reusability.

**Syntax :**

```java
import packageName.ClassName;  // Imports a specific class
import packageName.*;          // Imports all classes in the package
```

**Example :**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Imports Scanner class
import java.util.*;        // Imports all classes in java.util package
```

---

## 3. Class Definition Statements

The class is the fundamental building block of a Java program. Every Java program must have at least one class.

**Syntax :**

```java
class ClassName {
    // Class body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public class Car {
    // Class members go here
}
```

We can create any number of classes in one program.
There should be atleast one main class which should contains the main() method as main() method is the entry point for the program.

A class can include the following components which are known as **"Class Members"**:

* Variables : Also called fields or attributes, which hold data.
* Constructors : Used to initialize objects.
* Methods : Define behaviors or actions of the class.
* etc...

---

### 3.1 Variables Declaration Statements (Optional) [Class Members]

Variables are used to store data and are declared within the class (as fields) or within methods (local variables).

**Syntax :**

```java
dataType variableName = value; // Field or local variable declaration
```

**Example :**

```java
String model = "Tata Nexon";    // Field
int year = 2020;               // Field
```

---

### 3.2 Constructors Declaration Statements (Optional) [Class Members]

Constructor is a special method having same name as that of class name but should name have any return type.

A constructor initializes objects of a class. If no constructor is provided, Java supplies a default constructor.

**Syntax :**

```java
ClassName() {
    // Constructor body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public Car() {
    System.out.println("Constructor called!");
}
```

---

### 3.3 Methods Declaration Statements [Class Members]

Methods are the set of codes which performs a particular task.
We can create any number of methods in one class.

**Syntax :**

```java
accessModifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // Method body
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public void start() {
    System.out.println("Car Started");
}
```

---

### 3.4 Main Method [Class Members]

main() method is the entry point for java program from where program execution starts.
main() method can have different syntax but below is the standard syntax that we should use.

**Syntax :**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

**Example :**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Maheswaram...!!");
}
```

# Simple Java Hello Program


## MainApp.java

```java
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Deepak");
    }
}
````

In this example, we have a class named MainApp, and within this class, there is a main method. The method prints "Hello Deepak...!!" to the console.

---

## Breaking Down the program as below:-

## Java Hello Program Deep Explanation

---

### 1. public (Keyword - Access Modifier)

The "public access modifier keyword" declares that the MainApp class is accessible from anywhere in the program (other packages are also included) and JVM can invoke it from outside the class.

Note that when a class is declared as public, it must have the same name as the file name (in this case, MainApp.java).

---

### 2. class (Keyword)

The "class keyword" is used to define a class in Java, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

The class can contain :-

* Variables: Store data or attributes of the class.
* Constructors: Initialize the object’s state.
* Methods: Define the behavior or actions of the class.

---

### 3. MainApp (User-Defined Class Name)

The "MainApp" is the user-defined class name which contains the overall program.

The class must follows the Java naming conventions (CamelCase starting with an uppercase letter).

The "MainApp" class acts as the entry point of the program because it contains the main method.

---

### 4. { (Class Opening Curly Brace)

Here "{" denotes the beginning of the class definition.

Every class body is enclosed in curly braces.

---

### 5. public (Keyword - Access Modifier)

The "public access modifier keyword" here makes the main method accessible to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) so it can execute the program.

---

### 6. static (Keyword)

The "static keyword" denotes that the main method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.

It means that the main method is called without creating an object of the MainApp class.

---

### 7. void (Keyword - Return Type)

The "void return-type keyword" indicates that the main method does not return any value.

Since the program’s execution does not require any return value from the main method, it is declared void.

---

### 8. main (Pre-Defined Method)

The "main pre-defined method" is an entry point of the program from where execution begins.

The JVM looks for this specific method (main() method) to start the program. If there is no main() method then JVM will not start the program execution.

---

### 9. String[] (Parameter Type - Array of Strings)

The "String[] parameter type" is used for Command-line Arguments. It holds the arguments passed to the program when it is executed via the command line.

For example: If we run
`java MainApp Hello Deepak`, the array will contain:

* String[0] = "Hello"
* String[1] = "Deepak"

---

### 10. args (Parameter Name - Argunment Variable)

The "args" is the user-defined variable name for the String[] parameter.

"args" is the short name for arguments, but can be renamed to any valid identifier (e.g., data or parameters).

It is used to hold the command-line arguments passed to the program.

---

### 11. { (Method Opening Curly Brace)

Here "{" denotes the beginning of the main method body.

---

### 12. System (Pre-Defined Class Name)

"System" is the built-in Java class from java.lang package.

It provides access to system-level functionality, such as input/output streams, properties, and environment variables.

It contains:

* in: Standard input stream (e.g., keyboard input).
* out: Standard output stream (e.g., console output).
* err: Standard error stream (e.g., error messages).

---

### 13. . (Member Access Operator)

"." is the member access operator which is used to access fields, methods and nested classes of a class or an object.

For example: `System.out` accesses the out field of the System class.

It contains:

* in: Standard input stream (e.g., keyboard input).
* out: Standard output stream (e.g., console output).
* err: Standard error stream (e.g., error messages).

---

### 14. out (Pre-Defined Object)

"out" is the static member (field or property) of "System" class that represents the standard output stream (usually the console).

It is used to print the data like strings, numbers or objects to the console.

---

### 15. println (Pre-Defined Method)

"println" is the pre-defined method of "PrintStream" class (referenced by System.out).

It prints the given text or data to the console and moves the cursor to a new line.

---

### 16. "Hello Deepak" (String Literal)

"Hello Deepak" is the sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

The text Hello Deepak is passed as an argument to the println method and will be displayed in the console.

---

### 16. ; [Semicolon] (Statement Terminator)

";" marks the end of a statement in Java. Every executable statement must be terminated with a semicolon.

---

### 17. } (Method Closing Curly Brace:)

Here "}" marks the end of the main method body.

---

### 18. } (Class Closing Curly Brace)

Here "}" marks the end of the class definition.

# How to Compile and Run Java Program Using CMD ?

To compile and run a Java program using Notepad, follow these steps:

---

## Step 1: Set Up Java (if not already done)

Install JDK (if not installed click here for steps)

### Verify the installation:
- Open a Command Prompt.
- Type `java -version` and `javac -version`.
- If both commands display version information, Java is set up correctly.

---

## Step 2: Write the Java Program

- Open Notepad.
- Write Java program code as below :

### MainApp.java

```java
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Maheswaram");
    }
}
````

* Save the file with a `.java` extension.

**For example:**

* File Name: `MainApp.java`
* Location: Save it in a directory, e.g., `d:\JavaPrograms`

---

## Step 3: Compile the Java Program

* Open a Command Prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where we have saved the `.java` file.

**For example:**

```bash
cd /d D:\JavaPrograms
```

* `cd` means Change Directory.
* The `/d` switch changes the drive while navigating to the directory.

### Compile the program using javac:

```bash
javac MainApp.java
```

If there is no error in the code then it will generate `.class` file in the same location where `.java` file is present.
But if there is an error in code then it will display the error.

---

## Step 4: Run the Java Program

Run the compiled program using the java command:

```bash
java MainApp
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Maheswaram
```

---

# Deep Explanation of How Java Works Step by Step

Below diagram visually explains the steps involved when writing, compiling, and executing a Java program using Notepad and CMD.

How Java Works

Below is detailed explanation:

---

## Step 1: Writing the Java Program

We write our Java program in a plain text editor like Notepad.  
The program is saved with a `.java` extension, e.g., `MainApp.java`.

### MainApp.java
```java
public class MainApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Maheswaram");
    }
}
````

The `.java` file contains our Java source code, including a class with a `main` method (the entry point of the program).

---

## Step 2: Compilation

In compilation phase, we open CMD, navigate to the directory where our `.java` file is located, and run the `javac` command:

```bash
javac MainApp.java
```

### What happens in compilation phase:

* The Java Compiler (`javac`) reads the `.java` file.
* It checks the code for syntax errors.
* If there are no errors, it compiles the code into bytecode, a platform-independent intermediate representation.
* The bytecode is saved in a `.class` file (e.g., `MainApp.class`).

---

## Step 3: Bytecode (.class file)

The `.class` file contains the compiled bytecode, which can be executed on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Bytecode ensures Java's **"Write Once, Run Anywhere"** principle because it is not tied to a specific machine.

---

## Step 4: Execution

To run the program, we execute the `java` command in CMD:

```bash
java MainApp
```

Do not include the `.class` extension in this command.

### What happens during execution phase:

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**

* The JVM reads the bytecode in the `.class` file.
* It converts the bytecode into machine code that the operating system understands.
* It executes the machine code line by line.
* The `main` method is the entry point for execution.

---

## Step 5: Output

If the program contains a print statement, such as:

```java
System.out.println("Hello Maheswaram");
```

The JVM executes it, and the output is displayed in the Command Prompt:

```
Hello Maheswaram
```

---

# Introduction

In Java, when we provide data like 101, Deepak, 91.4, etc., we need to specify that which type of data we are providing.  
For example, we need to specify that 101 is of type int, Deepak is of type String, and 91.4 is of type float or double.  

So, we can say that in Java, every piece of data has a specific type, known as a **"data type"**.

---

## Purpose of Data Types :

Data types inform the compiler about the kind of data to be stored in a variable.

For example: Declaring  
```java
int rollno = 101;
````

tells the compiler that `rollno` will store an integer.

They help allocate the necessary memory for that data, ensuring that the program uses memory efficiently and that data is stored and processed correctly.

For example:
`int rollno` allocates 4 bytes of memory, same `float marks` will also store 4 bytes of memory.

---

## Data Types & Variables :

Data is stored in variables, and each variable is assigned a specific data type.
A variable's data type determines what kind of value it can hold and what operations can be performed on it.

For example :

```java
int rollno = 101;
// "int" is "data type"
// "rollno" is "variable"
// "101" is "literal" or "data" (value assigned to the variable)
```

---

## Diagram :

Data Type in Java

---

## Types of Data Types

There are 2 types of Data Types in Java which are as below :-

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non - Primitive Data Types

Below is the diagram representing the data types in java....

Data Types in Java

---

## 1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are pre-defined data types.

There are total 8 primitive data types in Java i.e.
boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.

Primitive data types have fixed memory sizes for example `char` always occupies 2 byte of memory, `int` occupies 4 byte of memory etc.

Click here to read primitive data types more deeply.

---

## 2. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-Primitive data types are user-defined or derived data types.

Non-Primitive data types examples are Strings, Arrays, classes, interfaces etc.

Non-Primitive data types does'nt have fixed memory sizes, they depends on the data or objects they reference.

For example, a String object’s memory usage depends on the string's length.

---

# Introduction

A variable is the name of memory location that can store data.  
In simple words we can say, variables are the containers used to store the data values.  

Real World Example :

Variables in Java Real World Example

Java Example :
```java
int rollno = 101;
````

## Variables in Java

Here data i.e. 101 is stored in memory, variable name i.e. rollno points to that memory and variable has its data type i.e. int.

So we can say that every variable has its :-

* **Data Type** : The type of data that it stores; for example int, char, long, float etc.
* **Variable Name** : The unique name within the scope which points to the memory location.
* **Value** : The data assigned to the variable.

## Variables in Java in Java

More Points about Varibales in Java :

Java is a statically typed language, so we must declare the type of data a variable will store.
For example if we create variable rollno having data as 101, then we have to specify its data-type i.e. int.

The value stored in a variable can change during program execution, which is why it is called a "variable“.

For example we have one variable no having 10 value, we can change its data as below :

```java
int no = 10;
System.out.println("no : "+no);     //output is no : 10

no = no + 20;
System.out.println("no : "+no);     //output is no : 30
```

## Types of Variables:

There are 3 types of variables in Java which are as below :-

1. Local Variable
2. Instance Variable
3. Static Variable

## 1. Local Variables

A variable defined within a block, method, or constructor is called a local variable.
Local variables are created when the block or method is executed and destroyed when the block or method exits.
The scope of a local variable is limited to the block in which it is declared; it cannot be accessed outside that block.
We have to initialize the local variables before using it.

## 2. Instance Variables

A variable defined inside a class but outside any method, block, or constructor is called an instance variable.
Instance variables are created when an object of the class is instantiated and destroyed when the object is garbage collected.
Each object of the class has its own copy of instance variables, so their values can vary between objects.
If we do not explicitly initialize the instance variables, then default values are assigned to them based on their data types (e.g., 0 for integers, null for objects).

## 3. Static Variables

A variable defined with the static keyword inside a class is called a static variable.
Static variables are shared among all objects of the class; a single copy is created and stored in the memory.
These variables are created when the class is loaded and destroyed when the class is unloaded.
Static variables can be accessed without creating an object, using the class name.

## Program for Local, Instance & Static Variables

```java
public class MainApp
{
    int no = 100;   //instance variable

    static int sno = 200;   //static variable

    void m1()
    {
        int no1 = 10;   //local variable
        System.out.println("Result 1 : "+(no1 + no));
        System.out.println("Result 2 : "+(no1 + no + sno));
        //System.out.println("Result 3 : "+(no1 + no2));    //error as no2 is local variable which is present in m2() method and thus cannot be used outside m2() method
    }

    void m2()
    {
        int no2 = 20;   //local variable
        System.out.println("Result 4 : "+(no2 + no));
        System.out.println("Result 5 : "+(no2 + no + sno));
        //System.out.println("Result 6 : "+(no2 + no1));    //error as no1 is local variable which is present in m1() method and thus cannot be used outside m1() method
    }

    static void m3()
    {
        int no3 = 30;   //local variable
        //System.out.println("Result 7 : "+(no3 + no)); //error because no is instance variable which cannot be used inside static method
        System.out.println("Result 8 : "+(no3 + sno));
        System.out.println("Result 9 : "+(no1 + no2 + no3));    //error because no1 and no2 are local variables and cannot be used outside their method scope
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        MainApp obj = new MainApp();
        obj.m1();
        obj.m2();

        MainApp.m3();  //static method can be directly called by class name
    }
}
```

## Output:

```
Result 1 : 110
Result 2 : 310
Result 4 : 120
Result 5 : 320
Result 8 : 230
```

# Introduction

Literals are constants used in Java programs to represent fixed values.  
They represent fixed values such as numeric values, characters, strings etc which are directly assigned to the variables.

For example :
```java
int rollno = 101;
````
<img width="718" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd02be25-7262-418f-aa48-de0595c3a412" />


## Variables in Java in Java

## Types of Literals

There are many types of literals in Java which are as below :-

1. Integer Literal
2. Floating-Point Literal
3. Character Literal
4. String Literal
5. Boolean Literal
6. Null Literal

---

## 1. Integer Literals

Integer Literals represents the whole numbers and can be written in different number systems.

Difference types of Integer Literals are :-

* **Decimal (Base 10)**: These are regular whole numbers (e.g., `int num = 42;`).
* **Binary (Base 2)**: These starts with `0b` or `0B` (e.g., `int bin = 0b1010;`).
* **Octal (Base 8)**: These starts with `0` (e.g., `int oct = 010;`).
* **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: These starts with `0x` or `0X` (e.g., `int hex = 0x1F;`).

### Rules for Integer Literals

* By default, integer literals are of type `int`.
* Use `L` or `l` to specify a long literal (e.g., `long bigNum = 123456789L;`).

### Program for Integer Literal :

```java
public class IntegerLiteralsExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Decimal Literal (Base 10): Regular whole numbers
        int decimal = 42;
        System.out.println("Decimal Literal: " + decimal); // Output: 42

        // Binary Literal (Base 2): Starts with 0b or 0B
        int binary = 0b1010; // Binary for decimal 10
        System.out.println("Binary Literal: " + binary); // Output: 10

        // Octal Literal (Base 8): Starts with 0
        int octal = 010; // Octal for decimal 8
        System.out.println("Octal Literal: " + octal); // Output: 8

        // Hexadecimal Literal (Base 16): Starts with 0x or 0X
        int hexadecimal = 0x1F; // Hexadecimal for decimal 31
        System.out.println("Hexadecimal Literal: " + hexadecimal); // Output: 31

        // Long Literal: Specified with L or l at the end
        long bigNum = 123456789L;
        System.out.println("Long Literal: " + bigNum); // Output: 123456789

        // Example of usage of all types together in calculations
        int sum = decimal + binary + octal + hexadecimal;
        System.out.println("Sum of all literals: " + sum); // Output: 91
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Decimal Literal: 42
Binary Literal: 10
Octal Literal: 8
Hexadecimal Literal: 31
Long Literal: 123456789
Sum of all literals: 91
```

---

## 2. Floating-Point Literals

Floating-Point Literals represents the numbers with decimal points.

Difference types of Floating-Point Literals are :-

* **Float**: These ends with `F` or `f` suffix (e.g., `float pi = 3.14F;`).
* **Double**: These are the default type for decimal literals (e.g., `double e = 2.718;`).

### Rules for Floating-Point Literals

* Use scientific notation for very large or small numbers (e.g., `double largeNum = 1.23e4;`).

### Program for Floating-Point Literal :

```java
public class FloatingPointLiteralsExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Float Literal: Ends with F or f
        float pi = 3.14F;
        System.out.println("Float Literal (pi): " + pi);

        // Double Literal: Default type for decimal numbers
        double e = 2.718;
        System.out.println("Double Literal (e): " + e);

        // Scientific Notation: Large number
        double largeNum = 1.23e4;
        System.out.println("Scientific Notation (largeNum): " + largeNum);

        // Scientific Notation: Small number
        double smallNum = 4.56e-3;
        System.out.println("Scientific Notation (smallNum): " + smallNum);

        // Precision with double
        double preciseNum = 3.14159265359;
        System.out.println("Double with precision (preciseNum): " + preciseNum);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Float Literal (pi): 3.14
Double Literal (e): 2.718
Scientific Notation (largeNum): 12300.0
Scientific Notation (smallNum): 0.00456
Double with precision (preciseNum): 3.14159265359
```

---

## 3. Character Literals

Character Literals represent a single character enclosed in single quotes (`'`).

Examples of Character Literals are :-

```java
char letter = 'A';
char digit = '7';
char specialChar = '@';
```

### Rules for Character Literals

* Character Literals must represent a single Unicode character.
* Escape sequences can be used for special characters:
  `\n`, `\t`, `\'`, `\\` etc.

### Program for Character Literal :

```java
public class CharacterLiteralsExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        char letter = 'A';
        System.out.println("Character Literal (letter): " + letter);

        char digit = '7';
        System.out.println("Character Literal (digit): " + digit);

        char specialChar = '@';
        System.out.println("Character Literal (specialChar): " + specialChar);

        char newlineChar = '\n';
        char tabChar = '\t';
        char singleQuoteChar = '\'';
        char backslashChar = '\\';

        System.out.println("Escape Sequence (newline):" + newlineChar + "This is after newline.");
        System.out.println("Escape Sequence (tab):" + tabChar + "This is after tab.");
        System.out.println("Escape Sequence (single quote): " + singleQuoteChar + "This is single quote.");
        System.out.println("Escape Sequence (backslash): " + backslashChar + "This is backslash.");
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Character Literal (letter): A
Character Literal (digit): 7
Character Literal (specialChar): @
Escape Sequence (newline):
This is after newline.
Escape Sequence (tab):	This is after tab.
Escape Sequence (single quote): 'This is single quote.
Escape Sequence (backslash): \This is backslash.
```

---

## 4. String Literals

String Literals represent a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (`"`).

Examples of String Literals are :-

```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
String empty = "";
```

### Rules for String Literals

* Strings are immutable in Java.
* Can include escape sequences (e.g., `"Line1\nLine2"`).

### Program for String Literal :

```java
public class StringLiteralsExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String greeting = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.println("String Literal (greeting): " + greeting);

        String empty = "";
        System.out.println("String Literal (empty): '" + empty + "'");

        String multiLineString = "Line1\nLine2";
        System.out.println("String with Escape Sequences (multiLineString): " + multiLineString);

        String quotedString = "He said, \"Hello!\"";
        System.out.println("String with Escape Sequences (quotedString): " + quotedString);

        String tabbedString = "Item1\tItem2";
        System.out.println("String with Escape Sequences (tabbedString): " + tabbedString);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
String Literal (greeting): Hello, World!
String Literal (empty): ''
String with Escape Sequences (multiLineString): Line1
Line2
String with Escape Sequences (quotedString): He said, "Hello!"
String with Escape Sequences (tabbedString): Item1	Item2
```

---

## 5. Boolean Literals

Boolean Literals represent one of two values: `true` or `false`.

Examples of Boolean Literals are :-

```java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean isHot = false;
```

### Rules for Boolean Literals

* Boolean Literals are used for conditional expressions and control flow.

### Program for Boolean Literal :

```java
public class BooleanLiteralsExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        boolean isHot = false;

        System.out.println("Is Java Fun? " + isJavaFun);
        System.out.println("Is it Hot? " + isHot);

        if (isJavaFun) {
            System.out.println("Java is fun!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Java is not fun!");
        }

        if (!isHot) {
            System.out.println("It is not hot today!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("It is hot today!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Is Java Fun? true
Is it Hot? false
Java is fun!
It is not hot today!
```

## 6. Null Literal

Null Literal represents the absence of a value for an object reference.

Example of Null Literal is :-

```java
String str = null;
```

### Rules for Null Literals

* `null` can only be assigned to reference types, not primitive data types.

### Program for Null Literal :

```java
public class NullLiteralExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String str = null;

        if (str == null)
        {
            System.out.println("The string is null, no value assigned.");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("The string has a value: " + str);
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
The string is null, no value assigned.
```

## Underscores in Numeric Literals (Java 7+)

We can use underscores in numeric literals to improve readability.

For example :-

```java
int million = 1_000_000;
double pi = 3.141_592_653;
```

### Rules to use Underscores in Numeric Literals

* Underscores cannot be used at the start or end of the literal, or next to a decimal point.

### Program for Underscores in Numeric Literals :

```java
public class NumericLiteralsWithUnderscore
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int million = 1_000_000;
        double pi = 3.141_592_653;

        System.out.println("Million: " + million);
        System.out.println("Pi value: " + pi);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Million: 1000000
Pi value: 3.141592653
```
